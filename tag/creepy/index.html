my dad just passed away, that would be like rubbing salt into a wound, except it
is. But they want to see it, so I’ll let it be.” Bob opened up his computer and
began traversing through directories, scanning for any pictures, videos that had
his dad (and preferably him) in it and started putting them all into a folder,
in which he would create a video montage in memory of his father. It was lonely
enough in the house after his mother passed away, but now, without his father,
he was completely alone.
