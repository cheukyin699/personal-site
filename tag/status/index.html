  <h3>Chip-8 is Great, Mate! <small class="meta">10 Aug 2015</small></h3>
  <p>Rhyming scheme aside, I’m finally somewhat finished the Chip-8 emulator package
that I was working on. Interested people can find the code here. This
includes:

  <h3>The End of School <small class="meta">22 Jun 2015</small></h3>
  <p>So here I am again, at the end of the school year. Well, almost the end - I
still have a public exam and still have to grab my report card, but at least all
the classes are over. With the end of the academic year, I can finally focus
full force on a lot more of my side projects, as well as some of my “online”
courses. As of writing, I am currently enrolled in a Coursera Android
class. The end of school also means that I could spend time honing my formerly
non-existent chess skills. Mind you, I still need to study for the exam, but
after that, I am/will be in full control for 2 months, right up till school
starts again in September.
