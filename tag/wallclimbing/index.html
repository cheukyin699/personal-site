  <h3>Wallclimbing is tiring <small class="meta">26 Jan 2015</small></h3>
  <p>Well, what do you know? Wallclimbing is tiring. Our class went wallclimbing
today. My fingers were sore and are still sore from all that gripping. How are
those tiny muscles in your fingers supposed to maintain your grip on a round
hand-hold? A major workout for the whole body, I suppose. It was very fun and
challenging. This was my first time going up a wall that tall (the ones at the
gym don’t count), with a guy manning the ropes of course. I should think about
taking up wallclimbing as a hobby.
