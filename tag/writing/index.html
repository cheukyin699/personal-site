  <p>Cory noticed the ominous black smoke billowing outwards, and decided to run to

  <h3>[Writing] Childhood Breakup <small class="meta">10 Jul 2015</small></h3>
  <p>“Hey dearest, come here for a second,” my mom beckoned me. Honestly, I was
fairly annoyed, given that I was in the middle of a gym battle, but I came
anyway.

  <h3>[Writing] Peripheral Disappointment <small class="meta">15 Jun 2015</small></h3>
  <p>Teddy was walking down the lifeless wooden corridor to the pre-trial. It was
paradoxical, really, that the hallway he was walking through glowed with strong
ambient-yellow fluorescent lights; the passage was radiating coldness. He knew
what he was going to do

  hear them out, and plea for a non-guilty verdict. The trial would be held
sometime else, but at least he wouldn’t have to deal with it now; this would
buy him more time. He knew that it was cliché, but he couldn’t help but think
about just 2 days ago, when everything was normal - the day of his interview.

  <h3>[Journal] The Road to be Good <small class="meta">14 May 2015</small></h3>
  <p>This will be a new kind of post: A journal entry (from my Ink Provoking
Journal). These are some topics about books, poetry, and all that kind of stuff.
It will or will not contain a fair bit of spoilers (if it is about some novel).
This one is based on the book “The Kite Runner”. If you haven’t read it, read
it, because it is good, and also because there are some suggestive spoilers in
the writing. Well, I’m not going to keep you waiting, so here you are!

  <h3>[Writing] The Old Video <small class="meta">04 Mar 2015</small></h3>
  <p>“You’d think they’d know better than to ask ME to do it.” Bob thought aloud. “If
my dad just passed away, that would be like rubbing salt into a wound, except it
is. But they want to see it, so I’ll let it be.” Bob opened up his computer and
began traversing through directories, scanning for any pictures, videos that had
his dad (and preferably him) in it and started putting them all into a folder,
in which he would create a video montage in memory of his father. It was lonely
enough in the house after his mother passed away, but now, without his father,
he was completely alone.
