Call me **Chuck**. I am a Computer Science student from Hong Kong who is a Christian.
I am interested in programming, maths and sciences, and pretty much anything
that I have been curious with. I like writing stuff in general, whether it be
fiction or non-fiction, tutorials and whatnot. Hope you have hope!

### Programming Setup

~~I have now switched to [neovim][nvim]. I used to use vim, but I [switched][swch]
in favour of the asynchronous function calling, meaning faster auto-complete,
and all that good stuff.~~

New computer, new things, good old vim.
