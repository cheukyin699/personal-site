### About Me

Call me **Cheuk**. I am a high school student from Hong Kong who is a Christian.
I am interested in programming, maths and sciences, and pretty much anything
that I have been curious with. I like writing stuff in general, whether fiction
or non-fiction, tutorials and whatnot. Hope you have hope!


### Blog Setup

Static blog is generated by [Jekyll][1]. Comments are hosted by [Disqus][2].


### Programming Setup

I have now switched to [neovim][nvim]. I used to use vim, but I [switched][swch]
in favour of the asynchronous function calling, meaning faster auto-complete,
and all that good stuff.
