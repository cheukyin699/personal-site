About Me
========

Call me **Cheuk**. I am a high school student from Hong Kong who is a Christian.
I am interested in programming, maths and sciences, and pretty much anything
that I have been curious with. I like writing stuff in general, whether fiction
or non-fiction, tutorials and whatnot. Hope you have hope!
