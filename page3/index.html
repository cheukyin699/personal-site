  <h3>The End of School <small class="meta">22 Jun 2015</small></h3>
  <p>So here I am again, at the end of the school year. Well, almost the end - I
still have a public exam and still have to grab my report card, but at least all
the classes are over. With the end of the academic year, I can finally focus
full force on a lot more of my side projects, as well as some of my “online”
courses. As of writing, I am currently enrolled in a Coursera Android
class. The end of school also means that I could spend time honing my formerly
non-existent chess skills. Mind you, I still need to study for the exam, but
after that, I am/will be in full control for 2 months, right up till school
starts again in September.

  <h3>[Writing] Peripheral Disappointment <small class="meta">15 Jun 2015</small></h3>
  <p>Teddy was walking down the lifeless wooden corridor to the pre-trial. It was
paradoxical, really, that the hallway he was walking through glowed with strong
ambient-yellow fluorescent lights; the passage was radiating coldness. He knew
what he was going to do

  hear them out, and plea for a non-guilty verdict. The trial would be held
sometime else, but at least he wouldn’t have to deal with it now; this would
buy him more time. He knew that it was cliché, but he couldn’t help but think
about just 2 days ago, when everything was normal - the day of his interview.

  <p>This will be a new kind of post: A journal entry (from my Ink Provoking
Journal). These are some topics about books, poetry, and all that kind of stuff.
It will or will not contain a fair bit of spoilers (if it is about some novel).
This one is based on the book “The Kite Runner”. If you haven’t read it, read
it, because it is good, and also because there are some suggestive spoilers in
the writing. Well, I’m not going to keep you waiting, so here you are!

  <h3>Mannerism Deflation <small class="meta">18 Apr 2015</small></h3>
  <p>Having good manners is important to leading a successful social life, and to not
be a sociopath. You say your amounts of “thanks” and “sorry” every single day.
Yet, we don’t usually think much about saying it. Have we been so used to saying
these words (pressured by parents) that the words have become the default
reaction to certain scenarios?

  <h3>How to Switch From one Samsung Phone to Another <small class="meta">27 Mar 2015</small></h3>
  <p>
  Download Samsung Smart Switch Mobile This also works for any android
phone/IOS phone switching to Samsung phone. Download this app for both
devices. For both phones, press “Android to Galaxy”, and hold them close
together. For the old phone, check the items that you want to send, then
press “Transfer”. If that doesn’t transfer, use the “Connect device manually”
option in the menu. This should take a relatively short amount of time.

  <h3>[Writing] The Old Video <small class="meta">04 Mar 2015</small></h3>
  <p>“You’d think they’d know better than to ask ME to do it.” Bob thought aloud. “If
my dad just passed away, that would be like rubbing salt into a wound, except it
is. But they want to see it, so I’ll let it be.” Bob opened up his computer and
began traversing through directories, scanning for any pictures, videos that had
his dad (and preferably him) in it and started putting them all into a folder,
in which he would create a video montage in memory of his father. It was lonely
enough in the house after his mother passed away, but now, without his father,
he was completely alone.
