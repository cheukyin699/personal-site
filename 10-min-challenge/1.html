<p>Jimmy was a pleasant little boy, living in the great town of Oxwood. His parents
owned a nice house, and they all lead a charming little social life. Charming,
as in interesting, and interesting as in TERRIBLY EXTREME. He was attending the
only elementary school in town, and starting from 3rd grade, was bullied
consitantly. He had to deal with the pushing, shoving, stealing of lunch money,
and so on. This is the day when things change.</p>

<p>"Hi Loqhart!" he waved. Loqhart nodded and smiled back, all the whites of his
teeth showing ... up until he walks up to Noah. Now Noah was one of the bigger
boys in the school, and a big boy he was. He was gathering the attention of
surrounding people as he started the scene by pointing at Loqhart.</p>

<p>"Hey Loqhart! I heard they were selling brains for a dime a dozen. Maybe you
should go grab one!"</p>

<p>Loqhart quickly dipped his head and continued walking in a direction
perpendicular of the original. For some reason, Jimmy decided to step in.</p>

<p>"I actually bought one of them. It has your name on it. I think it explains your
intellect - or lack thereof."</p>

<p>The school turned silent. Jimmy's smile was stuck to his face. A sheepish grin
that had originally appeared on Noah's face was slowly turning into a smirk, and
then a laugh.</p>

<p>"Dude, I can read. That's your name right there."</p>

<p>Laughter precipitated from the walls as Jimmy turned around and sped to his
  classroom.</p>
