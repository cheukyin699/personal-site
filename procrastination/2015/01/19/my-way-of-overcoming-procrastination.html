    <p><strong>Procrastination</strong> has become a huge problem in my (high) school career, and
probably will be.  From school projects to homework assignments to studying for
tests, I always had been avoiding it until the very last minutes. I don’t know
about you guys, but here are some methods I use to combat procrastination:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Make a Day Schedule</strong></p>

    <p>I know this sounds really cheesy, but it works. Having a plan of what you
 would be doing for the day helps immensely. I write my schedule on the night
 before the day I am scheduling. It also helps if you have a guy who could
 tell you if you are off track. Make this ‘schedule writing’ a part of your
 habit, and you won’t be procrastinating to write the schedule. Write it
 regularly once or twice and you’re good to go. I recommend writing it on a
 small notebook because there are lots of distractions if you write it on
 your computer. Unless you don’t want to keep a notebook around/don’t have
 one. Just write a schedule and <strong><em>stick with it</em></strong>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Finish all of your work at work</strong></p>

    <p>As a student, I don’t like doing homework at home because the opportunity
 cost of doing it at home is more significant than doing it at school. That’s
 why I do it at school. Then you’ll have more time at home to do whatever you
 like.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Have self-control</strong></p>

    <p>If you don’t have enough self-control, ask someone to watch over you. <em>ahem</em>
 Family &amp; friends <em>ahem</em>. Without sufficient self-control, you may not be
 able to do the (2) items listed above.</p>
  </li>
</ol>
